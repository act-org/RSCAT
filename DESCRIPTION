Description: As an advanced approach to computerized adaptive testing (CAT), 
  shadow testing (van der Linden(2005) <doi:10.1007/0-387-29054-0>) dynamically 
  assembles entire shadow tests as a part of 
  selecting items throughout the testing process.
  Selecting items from shadow tests guarantees the compliance of all content 
  constraints defined by the blueprint. 'RSCAT' is an R package for the 
  shadow-test approach to CAT. The objective of 
  'RSCAT' is twofold: 1) Enhancing the effectiveness of shadow-test CAT simulation;
  2) Contributing to the academic and scientific community for CAT research.
