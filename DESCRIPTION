Description: As an advanced approach to computerized adaptive testing (CAT), 
  shadow testing dynamically assembles entire shadow tests as a part of 
  selecting items throughout the testing process.
  Selecting items from shadow tests guarantees the compliance of all content 
  constraints defined by the blueprint. RSCAT is an R package for the 
  shadow-test approach to CAT. The objective of 
  RSCAT is twofold: 1) Enhancing the effectivness of Shadow-test CAT simulation;
  2) Contributing to the academic and scientific community for CAT research.
